    question: "What makes DAAML different from other automation tools?",
    answer:
      "DAAML is built for enterprise scale with anti-detection, residential proxies, and infrastructure that handles billions of requests. We're not a toy solutionâ€”we're serious infrastructure for serious teams.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I run DAAML in my own infrastructure?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We offer both managed deployment and self-hosted options. You can run DAAML entirely in your AWS, GCP, or on-premise infrastructure with full control.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's your pricing model?",
    answer:
      "We work with teams spending $10K+/month on automation infrastructure. Pricing is based on your scale, deployment model, and support needs. Book a demo to discuss your specific requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer a free trial?",
    answer:
      "We offer qualified prospects a 30-day pilot program to validate DAAML against your specific use cases. This includes dedicated engineering support and custom configuration.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of support do you provide?",
    answer:
      "Enterprise customers get dedicated Slack channels, 24/7 on-call engineering support, and quarterly business reviews. We're invested in your success.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can we get started?",
    answer:
      "Managed deployments can be live in 48 hours. Self-hosted deployments typically take 1-2 weeks depending on your infrastructure complexity and security requirements.",
  },
